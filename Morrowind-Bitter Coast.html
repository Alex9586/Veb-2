                    The Bitter Coast, named for the salt marshes along the coast, is the part of 
                    Vvardenfell's coast nearest to the mainland of Morrowind. 
                    This largely uninhabited area is in the far southwest of Vvardenfell and 
                    lies between the mountains of the West Gash to the east and the Inner Sea to the west. 
                    The northern boundary of the region is generally considered to be marked by Khartag Point 
                    just north of Gnaar Mok, and it follows the coast south and eastward through the tiny fishing 
                    and smuggling village of Hla Oad and the Imperial outpost at Seyda Neen, finally merging into 
                    terrain more reminiscent of the Ascadian Isles just west of Vivec.

                    The Bitter Coast is dominated by humid, putrid swamps and salt marshes. 
                    The giant bull netch float gently through the air, fearing no cliff racer or mudcrab. 
                    Off the coast, divers find kollops with pearls, but even more slaughterfish and man-like 
                    dreugh with their hard shells and tentacles. Herbalists come to this region to harvest 
                    the various mushrooms which thrived in the marshy environment. 
                    The region is also known as The Smuggler's Coast, since the secluded coves and islands are 
                    littered with smugglers operating out of their hidden caves. The ever-present fog and 
                    rain provide additional cover for their boats. No major action has been taken to curtail 
                    their actions, as many smugglers count on support from locals unhappy with high taxes on liquor. 
                    The Bitter Coast is a swamp, plain and simple.
                    <br>
                    Great, ragged trees provide a canopy beneath which pools of stagnant water grow a steady incursion
                     of green-brown moss. Local flora is replete with fungi including bungler's bane, hypha facia 
                     and violet coprinus, and the stagnant pools can reward the strong-stomached with glowing ampoule pods. 
                     Local fauna is mostly predatory, but not all that dangerous to the traveler. The few truly dangerous 
                     creatures on the Bitter Coast are kwama foragers and nix-hounds, the latter of which are delicious and 
                     useful for making potions.

                    The unwary traveler venturing into the open waters off the coast is in another league, however. 
                    The eternally persistent slaughterfish is thought by some to be a distant cousin to the cliff racer, 
                    as their temperament is very similar.
