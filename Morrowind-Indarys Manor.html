                    Indarys Manor is a Redoran stronghold in the Ashlands region, 
                    located on the site of Bal Isra. Players who advance to the 
                    House Redoran rank of Kinsman will be able to construct it by 
                    undertaking the related questline. Indarys Manor is the most 
                    populous stronghold and has the greatest overall storage;
