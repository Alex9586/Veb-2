        <h3> Morrowind:Attributes </h3>
        <hr>

        <p> 
            Attributes are the fundamental measurements that define a character's inherent abilities, 
            in contrast with Skills, which generally indicate how well a character performs specific actions. 
            There are eight primary Attributes in the game, several Attributes derived from those, and several 
            Other Attributes that reflect actions taken in the game world. The starting value of each primary Attribute 
            is based upon your character's race and gender. In addition, two Attributes will be "favored" by your 
            character's class with ten extra points.
        <br>
            With the exception of Luck, each primary Attribute governs three to five Skills. Three Attributes of 
            your choice can increase each time you gain a level, with the amount of increase depending on how 
            much you increased the Attributes' governed skills since the last level. The base value of a 
            primary Attribute can't be increased above 100 by leveling, but it can from various effects 
            (e.g., spells, enchantments, and potions) without this restriction. 
        </p>
