                    The Ashlands region is the largest contiguous geographical region on Vvardenfellâ€”a dry, 
                    inhospitable wasteland characterized by clusters of stone obelisks; minimal, highly-adapted 
                    vegetation; and bubbling ash mires. It encompasses land from the Urshilaku Camp on the northern 
                    shore of the Sea of Ghosts, west to the Redoran Council seat Ald'ruhn, then south to where the 
                    slopes of Red Mountain level off into the lava fields of Molag Amur. The southern border runs 
                    on an approximate line from Foyada Mamaea, near Balmora, to the southern border of the Grazelands.

                <p>
                    The mountainous region to the southeast of Molag Amur is sometimes considered part of the Ashlands
                    because of the similarity of its ecology, but is generally flatter, with open lava flows. Also, 
                    the slopes of Red Mountain itself are a separate region, bound by the Ghostfence. Frequent 
                    ash storms limit visibility and spread the Blight, affecting almost every creature found in the region.

                    Only the western part of the Ashlands is under permanent control of House Redoran. The shrine in Maar Gan
                     is an important Temple pilgrimage site, and the village's houses volunteer militia for the fight against
                      the forces of Dagoth Ur. The nomadic Ashlander tribe of the Urshilaku hunt for game, forage, and their 
                      herds find sparse grazing around ragged tent villages in the far northwest, but there are small 
                      Ashlander camps throughout the area outside the Ghostfence. The rest of the region is embattled with 
                      infractions of rogue Telvanni, bandits, and even vampires trying to gain a foothold. The interior of the 
                      Ashlands is thus largely devoid of permanent, occupied settlements, with the citadel of Ghostgate being 
                      the major exception. This is due to the lack of water and vegetation in the area, as it rarely ever rains. 
                      Scattered throughout the land are various caves, eggmines, Daedric and Dwemer ruins, and wizards' towers. 
                      Common species of the Ashlands are rats, wild guars, bull and betty netch, alits, kagoutis and the 
                      ever-present cliff racers. While the region's soil is too poor for cultivation, tough native species 
                      such as trama, fire fern and occasional lichen scratch out a rough existence in the rocky ground and 
                      provide valuable substances for the creation of potions.
