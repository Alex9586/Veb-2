            The game takes place on the island of Vvardenfell, a district in the Dunmeri province of Morrowind.
            It is smaller in scope than the previous games in the main series, Daggerfall and Arena, 
            yet much more detailed. This epic, open-ended RPG allows for a wide variety of character designs and 
            playstyles. The game continues to be sold two decades after its initial release, partially due to the 
            widespread mod community which has the potential to supply Morrowind with new content in perpetuity. 
            The Xbox 360 and Xbox One are backwards compatible with both the standard and GotY editions of Morrowind.</p> </div>
