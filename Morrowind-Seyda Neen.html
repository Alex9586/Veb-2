                <p>
                    The port of Seyda Neen, "the Gateway to Vvardenfell", is a small village in the southern Bitter Coast region, bordering the Ascadian Isles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    House Hlaalu governs Seyda Neen, but the Imperial Legion guards the seaport. 
                    Its native population is small, though it is a common stop for Imperial travelers 
                    going to and from Vvardenfell. The Grand Pharos is a unique lighthouse at the 
                    harbor mouth renowned for guiding mariners throughout the Inner Sea. 
                    Most visitors are processed through the Census and Excise Office, part of the 
                    Empire's Coastguard station at the harbor. Though no boats offer travel, 
                    Imperial cutters use the dock as a restocking point to control smugglers and 
                    pirates running the waters off the Bitter Coast. 
                    Silt striders provide convenient travel to Gnisis, Balmora, Vivec, and Suran.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Seyda Neen is especially significant as the starting point, 
                    where you begin aboard a prison ship in the port and where the main quest is begun. 
                </p>
                <h2>Census and Excise Office and Warehouse</h2>
                <p>
                    Socucius Ergalla is the chief agent in the Imperial Census and Excise Offices.
                    In addition to helping select class and sign, 
                    Socucius will provide release papers and training. 
                    There is a bedroll that can be used if a safe resting spot is needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A key, which can be obtained from a shelf next to 
                    Sellus Gravius in the second building, grants access to the warehouse 
                    across the street which holds armor, weapons, sundries and valuable illegal goods. 
                    You may also use the Tower Key Power to break in. 
                    Training is offered by Adraria Vandacia upstairs in the warehouse.
                </p>
                <div>
                <h2>Arrille's Tradehouse</h2>
                <p>
                    Arrille's Tradehouse is owned by the sole merchant in Seyda Neen, Arrille. 
                    He offers a selection of weapons, armor, spells, potions, and scrolls. 
                    He will not trade with you if you have Moon Sugar or Skooma in your possession. 
                    The tavern upstairs functions as the social hub for the town. 
                    Raflod the Braggart offers training and Hrisskar Flat-Foot has an early opportunity to make money. 
                    Behind the counter, Elone will give detailed directions to Balmora. She also offers training, but only to members of the Blades.
                </p> </div>
                <h2>People</h2> 
                <p>
                    Sellus Gravius is the second NPC you need to talk to; 
                    you give him your release papers from Socucius Ergalla, and he sends you on the first step of the Main Quest, 
                    to deliver a package to Caius Cosades in Balmora, which is best done before reaching level 4.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Giving Fargoth his ring will boost the disposition of Arrille, thus fetching better prices 
                    (and you can get the ring back later; get a Fargoth-related quest from the Nord guard upstairs at Arrille's).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Return to Socucius Ergalla in the Census and Excise Office for official matters, 
                    such as those involving a missing tax collector.
                </p>
                <h2>Getting There and Around</h2>
                <p> 
                    Transportation from Seyda Neen to other locations on the island is handled by Darvame Hleran, 
                    located at the silt strider on the northeastern edge of town. A short walk along the road east of 
                    town leads to, Balmora, Ebonheart, and into the Ascadian Isles. 
                    A trail northwest leads into the swamps of the Bitter Coast.
