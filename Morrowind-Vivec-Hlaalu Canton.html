                        The Hlaalu Canton is located on the west side of Vivec and 
                        is the first structure you encounter if you are traveling 
                        overland from Ebonheart. It is owned by House Hlaalu and 
                        hosts many services for retainers and visitors alike. 
                        Business is business, as they say. House Hlaalu councilman 
                        Crassius Curio resides here in his manor. He is a rather peculiar leader...

                        <h4>Getting Around</h4>
                        <p>
                            Outside on the canalworks level, a gondola can take you to the Arena, Foreign Quarter, 
                            or Temple cantons. Conveniently close to the gondolier is one of several 
                            ramps up to the waistworks, and to the left, due east, is a bridge to the 
                            Redoran Canton. Around the outside of the waistworks you will also find 
                            ramps upwards to the Plaza level. The Underworks and Canalworks are accessed 
                            through the indoor area of the waistworks. 
                            A bridge outside the Plaza level also connects to its counterpart in Vivec, Redoran.

                        <h4>Robbing the Vault</h4>
                        <p>
                            The vaults are accessible from Hlaalu, Treasury and the Records. 
                            Behind two heavy locked (95 pt. and trapped) bars and guarded by three 
                            Ordinators, you'll find the Vaults of House Hlaalu. The treasures here 
                            contain a full set of Glass Armor (except for the bracers) and chests 
                            with quality weapons, gold and jewels. If you can't find a way in 
                            without being caught, you can pick the first lock, pay gold, take 
                            the trap off, pay gold, etc (keeping in mind that you'll lose any 
                            stolen items you're carrying). Once inside, it is possible to 
                            sneak to the valuable items. This can be done with a relatively 
                            low sneak level. Another method is to taunt Alen Baren into combat, 
                            then kill him for his vault key -- then either pickpocket or taunt 
                            and kill the stationary Ordinator past the door for the second vault key.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The ordinator within the vault has a tendency to stay 
                                    away from the raised platform where the chests are located. 
                                    This makes placing a Mark on this platform to transfer loot in 
                                    and out relatively easy and "safe"
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    In the alcove on the left side of the raised platform, the 
                                    second-from-the-left chest contains a Random excellent melee weapon.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    One of the chests on the floor contains random ebony weapons.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
