                        <h4>Armor</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Base Armor — The standard, unenchanted armor, from which most other armor is derived.</li>
                            <li>Unique Armor — One-of-a-kind armor which uses generic graphics.</li>

                        <h4>Materials and Styles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Bonemold: Composed of softened bone molded into new shapes and hardened by resin. It is used for a few weapons and especially for mid-grade medium armor. Favored by Great House guards and nobles.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Chitin: Laminated insect shell design, used for a few low-end weapons and light armor. Typical among Vvardenfell's commoners and rogues. Ashlanders also make decorative shields of large bug carapaces, but these are not usable in-game.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Daedric: Expensive, highly refined, and extremely weighty form of Ebony, used for many weapons and heavy armor, the strongest in its class. Rarely used by everyday humanoids, as it all ultimately comes from the Daedra. Daedric gear is highly enchantable.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Dreugh: Made out of Dreugh shells and wax, used for a few weapons and high-grade medium armor.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Dwemer/Dwarven: Alloy created exclusively by the Dwemer, used for mid-grade weapons (labeled Dwarven) and heavy armor (labeled Dwemer). Trade in these goods is supposedly restricted (as archaeological artifacts claimed en masse by the Imperial crown), but there is no enforcement.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Ebony: Very rare, high-quality, and quite heavy black volcanic glass (think magical obsidian, not the wood the name suggests). Used for many weapons and for heavy armor, the second best in that class. Ebony is highly enchantable.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Glass: Created from rare metals and green volcanic glass, used for strong but light weapons, and for the best light armor in the game. Glass is fairly highly enchantable.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Imperial: Styles used by the Imperial Legion and Imperial Cult, including several styles of heavy armor (e.g., Imperial Steel, Imperial Templar), some medium armor (e.g., Imperial Chain), a few pieces of light armor, and a few weapons. It is superior to regular Steel gear, but is lesser than Silver.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Indoril: Ornate, high-end medium armor, favored by Ordinators. Indoril is fairly highly enchantable.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Iron: Cheapest of the metals, used for many basic weapons and lowest-end heavy armor.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Netch Leather: A natural material native to Vvardenfell, used only for low-end light armor. The boiled variety is hardened and superior.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Nordic: Styles used by Nord warriors (and many bandits and smugglers), including lightweight Nordic Fur Armor, several pieces of medium- and heavy-class armor (all low-grade), and a few low-to-mid-grade weapons, mostly axes and long blades.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Orcish: Styles of mid-grade weapons, mostly heavy axes and hammers, and mid-to-high-grade medium armor of light plate steel over cloth.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Silver: Silver-plated steel, for mid-grade weapons to use against were-creatures, the undead, and others resistant to normal weapons. Also used for a few pieces of mid-grade armor (mostly heavy class).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Steel: Slightly better than Iron; used for many weapons and heavy armor; low grade.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
