        <h3>Morrowind:Level</h3>
        <hr>
        <h6 style="margin-top:-5px"> <a href="Morrowind Main Page.html" target="_blank"> Morrowind</a></h6>
        <hr style="clear: both; visibility: hidden;">
        <p> A character's <b>level</b> is a measure of their overall experience and prowess. 
            Each named NPC has a level which never changes, while your character begins at 
            level 1 and continually increases in level throughout the game. Increases in level 
            result in increased Attributes, and they are achieved through increases in major and/or minor Skills. 
        </p>
        <h4> How to level up </h4>
        <hr>
        <p> Each class has five Major skills, five Minor skills, and seventeen miscellaneous skills. 
            Each time your character increases any combination of Major or Minor skills ten times, 
            they become eligible to gain a level. Both Major/Minor skills gained by paying a Trainer 
            to teach the skill and those gained by reading Skill Books count towards a level. 
            Miscellaneous skills do not count toward this progress at all 
            (but may count toward bonus multipliers applied to Attributes upon leveling up). 
            You can check your count of Major/Minor (or "M/M") skill increases toward a level at any time by 
            hovering the mouse cursor over the Level line of the Stats menu. </p>
            <p>Upon gaining the tenth increase of Major/Minor skills, and at each subsequent increase of any skill type,
             a message will encourage you to "rest and meditate on what you've learned". 
             You will gain a level the next time you rest for any length of time. 
             Using the wait command is not considered resting for this purpose. 
             You must use a bed or other resting object, or rest outside of towns or cities. </p>
            <p>For each level, a short explanation of the character's sudden, if not unexpected, 
                increase in power is shown along with an illustration of adventuring gear, 
                and the attribute multiplier list. While you rest, you will choose three of the primary 
                attributes to increase. Usually one or more of the Attributes will have multipliers next to them, 
                meaning that those Attributes will increase by more than one point if you choose them. 
                The multiplier for each Attribute is determined by the total number of times that skills 
                governed by that attribute have increased since the last level up:
                <ul>
                    <li> No skill increases = no multiplier (1 point) </li>
                    <li> 1–4 skill increases = 2× </li>
                    <li> 5–7 skill increases = 3× </li>
                    <li>8–9 skill increases = 4× </li>
                    <li> 10 or more skill increases = 5× </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                This includes increases of Major, Minor, and miscellaneous skills. 
                For example, if you increased Destruction three times and Alteration
                 two times during the past level, you would be able to increase Willpower by three points, 
                 regardless of your class. Note that Luck will never have a multiplier, 
                 since it does not govern any skills, but it can still be chosen for a one-point 
                 increase at any level up. As with leveling to 10/10, Major/Minor skills gained 
                 with Skill Books and Trainers count towards multipliers.
            </p>
            <p> Beware, however: While the counts for multipliers continue to accumulate for this level up,
                the count of Major/Minor skill increases to determine eligibility for level-up will not roll
                over to the next level. In other words, if you increase Major and Minor skills five times after
                you become eligible for a level up, your progress will show as "15/10" 
                before the level up, and then "5/10" afterwards. 
                Those extra five increases will not affect your multipliers for the 
                next level, however, so if you instead had ten excess major/minor increases, 
                upon leveling up you would be immediately eligible for another level up, with no attribute multipliers. 
                Fortunately, you would not gain the second level automatically, 
                so you would still have a chance to increase skills and earn multipliers before resting again.
            </p>
            <p>When you gain a level, in addition to increasing three primary Attributes, 
                your Health will automatically increase by 10% of your Endurance Attribute. 
                If you increased Endurance this level, the Health increase is calculated from the 
                increased Endurance. No rounding occurs; although Health is displayed as a whole 
                number in the Stats menu, the underlying value is actually a floating-point number.
            </p>
            <h3>Efficient Leveling </h3>
            <hr>
            <p> If you want to maximize your attribute bonuses at each level, 
                you can control the skill increases that determine your available attribute bonuses. 
                A perfectly efficient level up is one where three different attributes have exactly 
                ten skill increases each, and the other four have zero; 30 skill increases in a level 
                are possible if you increase 20 miscellaneous skills in addition to the 10 major/minor 
                skills necessary to level up. Alternatively, if two different attributes have exactly 
                ten increases while the other five have zero, and you choose Luck as your third attribute 
                to increase, that's also a level that wastes nothing. It's not easy to eliminate waste completely, 
                but here are some tips. 
            </p>
            <p> Pay attention to the major and minor skill set of your class at character creation. 
                Efficient levels ups are much easier when a decent variety of governing attributes are 
                represented among your major and minor skills. Even more important, however, 
                is that all the attributes are represented among your miscellaneous skills. 
                This way you always have the option of increasing skills for the specific attributes 
                you want without allowing your progress counter to run away.
            </p>
            <p>
                The moment you level up (or begin the game), plan the attribute increases you will want 
                to take at the next level. Then plan a set of skill increases that includes exactly ten
                in each of those three different attributes (or two different attributes, if you would
                like to take one point of Luck this level), and includes exactly ten in your major/minor
                skills. (Or fewer, if you already have some left-over progress.) Consider the equipment
                and tactics this plan will dictate, and then consider whether it is compatible with what
                you want to do in the near future (e.g., quests, dungeon crawls, burgling, or shopping sprees).
            </p>
            <p> Endurance is your special friend in the early game. Because it is the only attribute whose
                 value affects the increase of a derived attribute at every level, investing in heavy increases 
                 to Endurance in the lower levels can pay serious Health dividends for the rest of your 
                 character's life. It's easy, too: Just put on a good ensemble of medium and/or heavy armor 
                 and let some rat or mudcrab pummel you as long as you (and the armor) can take it.
            </p>
            <p>Take good notes. Unfortunately, the Stats menu does not actually show you how many specific 
                skill increases you have achieved since your last level up, so you will have to keep track of 
                them yourself. After each level up, write down your proficiency in each skill. 
                Then at any point you can calculate how much it has increased since, and you won't be 
                surprised with a 4x for Strength when you thought you had increased Long Blade ten times.
            </p>
            <p> Be adaptable. Because of the wide variety of ways your character gains experience, 
                accidental skill increases are nearly inevitable. There's no way to engage in combat 
                without gaining experience in at least one of the offensive and defensive skills, for example. 
                When they happen, be prepared to re-examine your plan and start aiming for a different set of 
                attributes. It's often better to take a level up that wasn't quite according to plan than to 
                allow a wasteful one.
            </p>
            <p> Getting all three multipliers to be the maximum five points still need be no more complicated 
                than two steps, one of which is done at character creation.
                <ul>
                    <li> At character creation: Ensure that you have at least one skill of each attribute among
                        your Major and Minor skills and two skills of each attribute among your Miscellaneous skills.
                        It is advisable not to rely on Armorer as one of these three skills because the supply of
                        armor and weapons to be repaired is neither sufficient nor reliable. 
                        Ensure that three skills that govern Strength, other than Armorer (out of a total of five) 
                        placed as needed. </li>
                    <li> If not writing down skill gains, you can simply level 10 Major/Minor skills. 
                        Whenever leveling attributes that are represented by fewer than three 
                        Miscellaneous skills, particularly Endurance and Personality, 
                        which have only three skills each, it is necessary to ensure that you 
                        gain enough points in any Major/Minor skills governed by these attributes 
                        to be able to reach a total of ten. You can begin leveling Miscellaneous skills 
                        once you have received the message encouraging you to "rest and meditate on what 
                        you've learned". Raise Miscellaneous skills by up to four points each for a total of ten. 
                        If you are writing down every single point, and have a skill for every attribute in M/M, 
                        it is possible to reduce the total number of Miscellaneous skills required for all 
                        three maximized multipliers to 20. Either 3 M/M + 7 Miscellaneous in two attributes, 
                        and 4 M/M + 6 Miscellaneous in one. Or 4 M/M + 6 Miscellaneous in two attributes, 
                        and 2 M/M + 8 Miscellaneous in one. </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3> Maximum Level </h3>
            <hr>
            <p> Once you have reached 100 in all Major and Minor skills, you are at your character's maximum level, 
                which varies depending on a few different factors. Major skills start out at 30 and Minor skills 
                start out at 15, which means you potentially have 775 skill increases that count towards level 
                (making level 78 the maximum level possible without cheating). 
                However, most characters have additional bonuses to these skills at character creation, 
                from specialty or race. This makes those skills easier to use from the beginning, 
                but limits the maximum level that the character can attain, which also limits the 
                maximum amount of base health.
            <br> Reading skill books will provide extra skill points, 
            the raise counts towards leveling up and contributes to the attribute bonus. 
            With 5 skill books for each skill and a total of 10 major/minor skills, 
            there are potentially 50 skill increases on top of the 775 mentioned above, 
            bringing the maximum level possible without cheating to 83.
            </p>
            <p>There are at least three methods for going beyond this level:
                <ul>
                    <li>The easiest way is to equip an item that raises an attribute above 100, 
                        such as the Boots of Blinding Speed, as this will enable a character to continue 
                        using trainers to skill up skills – such as Hand-to-Hand, Unarmored, and 
                        Short Blade, for Speed – and to thus obtain levels from those skills 
                        (as long as they are Major or Minor). While one's level may increase this way, 
                        the governing attribute of the item will not be affected, since the actual skill remains 100, 
                        even though you are allowed to "pseudo-level" it while the attribute max is temporarily raised 
                        by the item (e.g. to 300 by Boots of Blinding Speed). 
                    </li>
                    <li>Going to jail can randomly lower skills, which can then be retrained for additional credit. 
                        Also, if Security and Sneak are major skills, they can be randomly raised by going to jail, 
                        which will not increase the skill above 100 but will count towards the next level. 
                    </li>
                    <li> As an alternative to spending time in jail, if one uses a spell or potion to temporarily 
                        lower a skill, that skill can be trained at its respective skill-trainer as long as your 
                        temporary skill level is lower than their level in the skill (and the trainer's skill level 
                        can be temporarily raised if necessary). Though this will never get a skill over 100, 
                        it will always count towards your character's next level. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Another post-leveling strategy that is perhaps less of an exploit is to max your skills and 
                        then read books. Many books raise skills when opened for the first time. If your skill is already at 
                        100, the book will give you one additional point towards your character level. There are 5 skill 
                        books for each skill which means a possibility of 5 points in each of your 10 major and minor 
                        skills or an additional 5 levels. Note some skill books exist in open and closed form in-game and 
                        count separately so additional level-ups are possible. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Once all attributes are at 100, additional levels provide nothing except an extra 10 Health each time 
                (though some calculations like vendor discounts factor in character level and scale up slightly). 
                Other than this, the only real use for going beyond your maximum is fixing inefficient leveling 
                (such as hitting the max level without 100 Luck).
