                        <p>
                            Destruction spells harm living and undead creatures, and mages specializing in destruction are usually war wizards. 
                            There are many common variants of destruction spells, not to mention the countless custom versions created by ambitious 
                            spellcasters. There are so many different destruction spells that it helps to divide them into five different classes of
                            effects: elemental damage, attribute-draining, attribute-damaging, vulnerability, and disintegration.

                    <p>
                        Chance of success in percent is
                        <code> (Spell's skill * 2 + Willpower / 5 + Luck / 10 - Spell cost - Sound magnitude) * (0.75 + 0.5 * Current Fatigue/Maximum Fatigue)</code>
                        <br> Spell Damage is <code>Damage * (1 - ( Resistance - Weakness )/100)</code>. 
                        <br>Spell Cost (the amount of magicka a spell takes to cast) for custom spells is 
                        <code>( Min Magnitude + Max Magnitude ) * ( Duration + Area + 1 ) * ( Base Cost / 40 ) * ( 1.5 if On Target )</code>, 
                         rounded down. This formula is calculated per spell effect and summed together for multi-effect spells. Built-in spells 
                         may have a different cost than their custom equivalent.
                         <br><br>
                         <b>Example:</b> You are a lvl 1 Breton and you have 20 Destruction, 60 Willpower, 50 Luck and have 150 Maximum Fatigue, 
                         you are not affected by Sound and you are at maximum fatigue. The spell you want to cast is "Fire Bite":
                         <br><br>
                         <code>(20 * 2 + 60 / 5 + 50 / 10 - 6 - 0) * (0.75 + 0.5 * 150/150) = 63.75% chance that you will succeed</code>
                         <br><br>

                    <h4>Notes</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If Resistance - Weakness is equal to 100 or more, the effect is resisted.</li>
                        <li>Resistance/Weakness to Magicka does not affect elemental damage.</li>
                        <li>"Self" spells have an Area value of 1.</li>
                        <li>"Target" spells multiply the above spell cost by 1.5.</li>
                        <li>The lowest value possible on a slider is 1 (one), despite it displaying zero.</li>
                        <li>Spells without magnitudes (such as Invisibility) behave as though they have magnitudes of 1.</li>
