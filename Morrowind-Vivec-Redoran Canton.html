                        The Redoran Canton is one of the nine cantons in Vivec, located south of the Foreign Quarter, between the Hlaalu and Arena Cantons. It is controlled by House Redoran and hosts many services for its retainers and visitors alike.
                        <br><br>
                        The canton is also the site of two Morag Tong writs and several quests from Faral Retheran in the Redoran Treasury. It houses considerable Redoran treasures in its vaults. The Sixth House continues its assault on House Redoran in the sewers.

                        <h4>The Plaza</h4>
                        <p>
                            Saren Manor has a trap door leading to Toris Saren, who is hiding from a Writ. In the Dralor Manor is a key to the Vaults in an unlocked cupboard upstairs.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <h4>The Waistworks</h4>
                        <p>
                            The Waistworks contains Redoran Prison cells, which leads to the Treasury, which in turn connects to the Plaza and the Vault. In the Treasury is Faral Retheran, a House Cousin and quest giver for House Redoran . A Scout and Drillmaster Quarters offers training. An Indoril helmet and shield are lying on a chest, another on a table. There are bunk beds for Redoran Retainers.

                        <h4>The Canalworks</h4>
                        <p>
                            The Redoran Ancestral Vaults is guarded by three leveled Undead and an Ash Creature. It contains a crate with silver and magical weapons and three locked chests with gold.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>The Underworks</h4>
                        <p>
                            In the northwest corner is a small Sixth House altar guarded by an Ancestral Ghost, complete with an Ash Statue, Corprusmeat along with a corpse holding a Rusty Key and a Daedric Dagger.

                    <div>
                        <h4>Robbing the Redoran Treasury</h4>
                        <p>
                            This is easily the best free loot haul in the entire game. 
                            It will have no effect on Redoran players' faction reputation (unless caught). 
                            Ahnassi might have told you that Dralor Manor in Redoran Plaza contains a key 
                            (in Favela Dralor's bedroom drawers) which opens two locked (60) 
                            chests with gold and jewels. Or you may have just incidentally found 
                            it while poking around in Vivec homes. Ahnassi's details aren't quite right. 
                            The key legally disarms and opens the trapped and locked (90) Lower Vault door 
                            in the treasury, as well as some chests inside. The other contents of that 
                            room are worth far more, both in sale and gameplay value, 
                            than some gold and jewels, though you get those as well.
                            <br>
                            Enter the Redoran Treasury, also in Redoran Plaza. 
                            You'll find the Upper and Lower Vaults (both downstairs from the entrance) 
                            heavily guarded by retainers and Ordinators.
                            <br>
                            <b>The Lower Vault</b>is on the bottom floor. Simply use the key to enter this vault, 
                            which triggers no reaction from anyone. Go inside and wait for any guards in the vault 
                            to go out where Drelse is, then close the door (actually, you can even simply wait, 
                            using the "wait" button, for a few hours and the guards will leave, even if you have 
                            the cell door closed!). Since the cell door is coded as solid instead of see-through, 
                            you can pick up and unlock anything when alone in here, even when you can see guards 
                            through the door's bars.
                            <br>
                            The key also opens the two small chests of gold (comparatively high amounts), while the chest of jewels (random) actually has no lock. Other loot laying around in this room:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Several pieces of Ebony Armor – the second-best Heavy class in the game – including cuirass, greaves, closed helm, and tower shield</li>
                                <li>Several pieces (random) of Glass Armor (excluding bracers) – the best Light Armor in the game – found in a crate</li>
                                <li>Enchanted Bonemold Armor pieces (mid-range Medium Armor</li>
                                <li>High-end weapons, a Glass War Axe and Dagger, and an Ebony Mace and Shortsword</li>
                                <li>Random jewels, mid-range weapons, and/or armor pieces (e.g. Dwarven/Dwemer) in another crate</li>
                                <li>
                                    Random gold, jewels and/or low to high-end weapons and armor in three larger locked chests (the key does not work on them); this loot may be leveled.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The chest on the table with the ebony weapons and armor contains two random ebony weapons</li>
                                        <li>There are two chests that contain a random excellent melee weapon. One is on the floor below the table covered in ebony armor and weapons; the other is on the back wall immediately to the right of the baskets.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Random alchemy ingredients and clutter, in baskets and a bag, which seem rather out of place here</li>
                                <li>A Gold Armor Cuirass, Helm, and Pauldrons.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <b>The Upper Vault</b> is not opened by the same key and is also trapped and locked (90). Getting in 
                            is easiest done from the hallway, with Telekinesis (15 feet), a probe, and a Scroll of Ekash's Lock Splitter 
                            if you can't do Open for 95 points or pick such a lock. It's just a waiting game, for all the patrolling Ordinators 
                            to be out of sight at the same time for just long enough to cast, disarm, and unlock. Trap at least one guard back 
                            in the Lower Vault to reduce observers. A riskier but less-waiting variant is to do this routine directly behind 
                            Beldrose Dralor and add Sneak and Chameleon to hide your activities, or get him to turn around away from the door 
                            and do the same combo directly at the door but without the Telekinesis component. Once the Upper Vault is opened, 
                            you can plunder it, too, without any problem as soon as the guards leave and you close the door.
                            <br>
                            This room contains three locked (50) chests and two locked (25) chests, plus other containers and loose loot, adding up to:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Substantial amounts of gold and jewels</li>
                                <li>Random, generic enchanted jewelry/clothing</li>
                                <li>Random Exquisite-level clothing, unenchanted</li>
                                <li>Ebony Longsword and Shortsword</li>
                                <li>A Glass Longsword</li>
                                <li>An Orc Warhammer</li>
                                <li>A crate of one each of the regular Silver weapons</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            Various items from these rooms are badly damaged and must be repaired to sell for a good price. 
                            This should be done yourself, even with a terrible Armorer skill rating. Sell an undamaged bit of loot, 
                            and use some of the proceeds to buy a bunch of Repair Tongs or Apprentice or Journeyman Armorers Hammers 
                            from a Blacksmith who restocks them, and burn through them until the job is done. 
                            (High-end, light-weight hammers are expensive and have far fewer uses; they are for 
                            carrying while adventuring, for doing emergency repairs. Routine repair work should be done with the cheap stuff. 
                            Tip: Keep a pile of cheap tools on the floor at merchants to whom you regularly sell 
                            arms and armor, so you can repair them on-site to maximize sale value.)
                            <br>
                            The main game-design purpose of this dual hoard of magnificent booty 
                            (among other ones, like Ghorak Manor with its scary-looking Orcs who docilely let you empty their armor crates) 
                            appears to be to give repeat players a way to gear up quickly and get on with it, having already been through the 
                            "explore in confusion and wonder, and fight innumerable rats and crabs" phase on their first play-through. 
                            New players focused on the Main Quest and faction quests are unlikely to find this Lower Vault key by accident 
                            or by Ahnassi quest (only available to males anyway) until perhaps fairly late in the game. 
                            Another purpose this "Rob-me Vault" may serve is helping out exploratory open-world players with 
                            little interest in quests, who have been leveling without receiving many or any quest rewards, but looking everywhere at everything.
