                        <h3>Common Diseases</h3>
                        <p>
                            These are the most common diseases in Morrowind. 
                            They can all be cured with the Cure Common Disease effect, 
                            or you can protect yourself with the Resist Common Disease or Resist Magicka effects. 
                            Some races are naturally resistant to diseases. Argonians, High Elves, 
                            Redguards, and Wood Elves each have 75% resistance. 
                            You can achieve 100% resistance after a point in the Main Quest.

                        <h3>Blight Diseases</h3>
                        <p>
                            There are also other diseases, called Blight diseases, in Morrowind. 
                            These are more serious, and slightly harder to cure. 
                            You will probably need a Cure Blight Disease spell (or items that provide this effect) 
                            if you venture into the Ashlands, Molag Amur, or Red Mountain areas, where these diseases 
                            are prevalent. A free version of this spell (with the lowest casting cost) can be obtained 
                            from the real Ashmask of Vivec. The use of Resist Blight Disease or Resist Magicka effects 
                            to protect yourself from catching these afflictions in the first place is recommended when 
                            engaging Blighted and Ash creatures.

                        <h3>Corprus Disease</h3>
                        <p>
                            Worst of all the afflictions is the dreaded Corprus Disease, also known as the "Divine Disease". 
                            While technically a type of Blight disease, it has (in lore) no known cure, 
                            although Divayth Fyr in Tel Fyr spends his days researching one in the Corprusarium.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are only two ways to get this disease: during the Sixth House Base mission during the Main Quest 
                            (this is completely unavoidable) and during the Disease Carrier quest in the 
                            Tribunal Temple quest line (this is a game-breaking bug).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Corprus is sometimes called the "Divine Disease" by followers of Dagoth Ur, 
                            and it is not truly a disease at all, but the physical effects of the deity's power on mortal flesh. 
                            Corprus metastases (i.e., big chunks of diseased flesh) are often eaten by the afflicted, 
                            negating any need for other food. It also plays a key role in the creation of Ash Creatures: 
                            followers of Dagoth Ur close to his power are slowly transformed into powerful Ash Creatures, 
                            such as the Ascended Sleeper, while his weaker followers, like the Dreamers, eventually rot 
                            and become Corprus Stalkers and Lame Corprus.
                        </p>
