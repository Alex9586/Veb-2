                        Despite conflicts between many factions (especially across Imperial and native lines, e.g. 
                        Mages Guild versus Telvanni, or Imperial Cult versus Tribunal Temple), it is usually possible to 
                        join and advance in whichever factions you choose, 
                        if you are mindful of the conflicts and work around them.

                    <p>
                        The Great Houses are the large establishments, throughout the Morrowind province, 
                        of extended lineages of "civilized" Dunmer, with many non-Dunmer retainers (and sometimes officers). 
                        The Great Houses' traditions derive from ancient Dunmer clans and tribes, but they now function something 
                        like political parties. Of the Empire's five recognized Great Houses, only three have a governing and commerce 
                        presence on the island of Vvardenfell in particular.

                    <h4>Native Morrowind Factions</h4>
                    <p>
                        These factions are mostly establishments with long-standing regional Dunmer traditions, 
                        and usually have to do with reclaiming Morrowind for the Dunmer, and resisting the colonial Imperial culture. 
                        There are some internecine conflicts among these native factions (e.g., between the Ashlanders of Vvardenfell and the Tribunal Temple, 
                        and enmity between Ashlander tribes). The real odd one out is Twin Lamps, which is recent, comprised primarily of non-Dunmer in the region, 
                        and opposed to a particular Dunmer practice. Of Morrowind's endemic factions, only the Morag Tong 
                        has the character of a guild, and of them it is the only one with a history and presence outside Vvardenfell.

                                        The newest of the Dunmer religions, it is tolerant of and has assimilated the original ancestor worship 
                                        and "Good Daedra" cults to the extent it can, while focused on servitude to a trio of living gods, 
                                        the Almsivi Tribunal. It is markedly hostile toward the Nerevarine Cult (whom the Temple ruthlessly suppress) 
                                        and toward the Sixth House (above). While the Temple is vying for converts with the Imperial Cult, 
                                        the two religions largely just maintain non-interference with each other. Some people are in the congregations of 
                                        both faiths, and various locations have both a Tribunal Temple shrine and an Imperial Cult altar in fairly close proximity. 
                                        As a player character, you can join both factions with little direct conflict of interest.
